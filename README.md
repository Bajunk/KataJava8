# Coding Dojo - Kata Java 8 : Streams

Simple kata to demonstrate the use of Streams in Java 8 using the good old GildedRose shop !

Just try to fill the code to make all the tests pass.

Feel free to do PRs if you have some interesting use cases to show !


Other Katas :

* [Kata about TDD based on the StringCalculator](https://github.com/jripault/KataStringCalculator)
* [Kata about mocks](https://github.com/jripault/KataMock)

And a webapp I made have a webserver validating test code of katas attendees
